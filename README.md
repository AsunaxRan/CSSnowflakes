CSSnowflakes
=============

CSS snowlakes for your website, no JS needed!! Working in modern browsers using CSS animation (IE10+).

Just add the code from __snippet.html__ to your webpage and enjoy beautiful falling snowflakes. Snowflakes should not be visible in older browsers, thus not breaking layout.

Tip: You can change *color*, *text-shadow*, *font-family* and *font-size* at the beginning of the snippet.

Tip2: You can switch snowflakes off with :

    .snowlakes { display: none; }
