CSSnowflakes
=============

CSS snowlakes for your website, no JS needed!! Working in modern browsers using CSS animation (IE10+).

Just add the code from snippet.html to your webpage and enjoy beautiful falling snowflakes. Snowflakes should not be visible in older browsers, thus not breaking layout.

Tip: You can change color, text-shadow, font-family and font-size at the beginning of the snippet.
Tip2: You can switch snowflakes off with adding :

    .snowlakes { display: none; }
